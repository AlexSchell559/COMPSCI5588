List 3 checks before deploying a model to production.,"List 3 checks before deploying a model to production. 

1. Validate data: Make sure that the data is clean and contains the required features. 

2. Check for overfitting: Check if the model has overfitted the data by looking at the model's predictive accuracy. 

3. Check for outliers: Check if the data contains outliers, which can affect the model's accuracy. 

4. Check for correlation: Check if the data has any significant correlation with the",3.03
