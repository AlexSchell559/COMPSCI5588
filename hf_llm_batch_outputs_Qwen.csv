List 3 checks before deploying a model to production.,"List 3 checks before deploying a model to production. Before deploying a model to production, it's crucial to ensure reliability, accuracy, and robustness. Here are three key checks:

1. **Performance Evaluation on Real-World Data**: Validate the model's performance using data representative of real-world scenarios. This includes checking metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC (depending on the problem type), and ensuring they meet business requirements. Testing on out-of-distribution or edge cases is essential to avoid unexpected failures.
